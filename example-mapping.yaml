# Natural keyboard orienation is when buttons are on the left
# side and knobs are on the right. However you may want to use
# keyboard in another orienation. To avoid remapping button
# positions in your head, just given it here.
# Possible values are:
#   (horizontal)
#   - 'normal': button on the left, knobs on the right
#   - 'upsidedown': button on the right, knobs on the left
#   (vertical)
#   - 'clockwise': button on the top, knobs on the bottom
#   - 'counterclockwise': button on the bottom, knobs on the top
orientation: normal

# There are different models of keyboard with different number
# buttons and knobs. Write it here for proper handling.
# Count rows and columns when keyboard is in normal orienation,
# with knobs on the right side.
rows: 3
columns: 4
knobs: 2

# Layers are alternative key mappings which may be programmed.
# Current layer is changed using button on the side of keyboard
# and displayed with LEDs on top (only for the moment of changing).
# All keyboards I saw had three layers, but I suppose other variants
# exist.
layers:
  - buttons:
      # Array of buttons. In horizontal orienations it's `rows` rows
      # `columns` buttons each. In vertical: `columns` rows
      # `rows` buttons each.
      - ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
      - ["e", "f", "g", "h"]
      - ["i", "j", "k", "l"]
    knobs:
      # Knobs are numbered from left to right in horizontal orientation
      # and from top to bottom in vertical one.
      - null
      - null

  - buttons:
      # Each entry is a sequence of 'accords' — combination of key
      # with modifiers, like 'ctrl-alt-a' or 'win-rctrl-backspace'.
      - ["m,alt-f1", "n", "o", "p"]
      - ["q", "r", "s", "t"]
